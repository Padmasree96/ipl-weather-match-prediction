🚨 Mini Project Drop on GitHub!
🎯 IPL Weather Match Prediction — where cricket meets climate and code 🏏🌦️
As part of my academic journey in AI & Data Science, I explored how weather conditions can influence IPL match outcomes. This mini project blends match stats + weather data to build a predictive model using Python and machine learning.
🔍 What’s inside:
- 📊 Data wrangling with Pandas & NumPy
- 🌆 Custom dataset with city-wise temperature, humidity, and weather types
- 🤖 ML models trained on historical IPL + weather data
- 📈 Match-day prediction dashboard
- 🌦️ Weather impact analysis on game dynamics
💡 Why this mini project?
Because sports analytics isn’t just about scores—it’s about context. Rain delays, pitch conditions, and climate patterns can shift momentum. This project is a step toward smarter, situational forecasting in sports.
